# Enviro-Sphere
Enviro Sphere is a platform where students shop for sustainable products made from waste materials and contribute their own waste. NGOs and schools transform these materials into valuable items. 70% of proceeds support child education; 30% scales the initiative. Join us in fostering a sustainable future!

Here's how it works👷🏻:

1️⃣ Students from our college and nearby places can shop 🛍️ for sustainable products made from waste materials on our website. 🛒💚

2️⃣ Students can also contribute their waste materials, fostering a culture of recycling and reuse. ♻️🌱

3️⃣ We collect these materials and provide them to NGOs 🧑🏻‍🏫 and schools 🏫 where creativity flourishes. 🎨📚

4️⃣ The creative minds at these NGOs and schools transform the waste into meaningful products. ✨🌟

5️⃣ We list these products on our website, and once sold, 70% of the proceeds go back to the NGOs and schools to support child education, while the remaining 30% helps us scale this initiative. 📈💡
