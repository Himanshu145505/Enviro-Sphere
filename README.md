# Enviro-Sphere
Enviro Sphere is a platform where students shop for sustainable products made from waste materials and contribute their own waste. NGOs and schools transform these materials into valuable items. 70% of proceeds support child education; 30% scales the initiative. Join us in fostering a sustainable future!
